## Project Structure 

The eagerwords folder is currently redundant. The reason for its addition is 
to allow parallel projects to be created for libraries.

For now the librarirization project has been abandoned. When we return to it,
the eagerwords/libs folder would be moved to this folder, so its projects 
beome parallel to the main eagerwords application.
