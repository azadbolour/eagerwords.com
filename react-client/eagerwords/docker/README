To build the production UI bundle, first tag the source in git and
push the tag, then run the script build-bundle-from-tag.sh giving it
the docker namespace, the docker tag, and the server port to be
used. 

Note that in production, the server port is not used and is left empty.

Some details:

- Dockerfile.nodejs - For the base image. Just get node and basic utilities here.
  Reused as the base of the builder ro reduce docker image build times.

- build-nodejs.sh azadbolour 0.8.0 - Use the dockerfile to build an image with
  nodjs and various utilities.

- Dockerfile.eagerwords.com.react-builder - For the image of the builder.

- build-react-builder-image.sh azadbolour 0.8.0 'http://localhost:6587' -
  Build the docker image of the builder.

- run-react-builder-container.sh --tag 0.8.0 - Run the image to produce a
  production build.

The production build is copied to the host directory:

   /opt/data/eagerwords.com/package/react-client/build/

The package directory /opt/data/eagerwords.com/package/ is mapped to the same
path in the host file system.
