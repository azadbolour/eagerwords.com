        To use the full range of EagerWords' Services, you will have to create a User
        Account (“Account”).
      </p>
      <p>
        When setting up your Account, you must provide accurate and complete

        your permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        EagerWords uses passwordless login based on login tokens sent to your email
        address. As a result, anyone with access to your email account may access
        EagerWords' Services as yourself. You agree that anyone authorized to access the
        email account that you use to login to EagerWords is also authorized to use
        EagerWords' Services on your behalf, unless specifically instructed by you not
        to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may not transfer your account to someone else or use someone else’s
        account without their permission. If you find or suspect that your account is being
        used by an unauthorized person, you agree to immediately remove your account
        by unregistering from EagerWords.
      </p>

      <h4>End User Licenses</h4>

      <p>
        Your License to the Platform. Subject to your compliance with this Agreement,
        EagerWords will permit you to access and use the Platform solely for lawful
        purposes and only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and any other
        agreement you may have entered into with EagerWords.
      </p>

        Your License to the Content. Unless otherwise noted on the Platform, all
        content, data, or other information provided through the Platform made by
        EagerWords (collectively “Content”) is owned by EagerWords. By accepting this
        Agreement, EagerWords grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and
        revocable license to use the Platform and Content only for the purposes for

        transmit, augment, transfer, create derivative works, sell, or participate in
        the sale or transfer of the Platform, or in any other way exploit any of the
        Content, software, or services contained in the Platform without the prior
        written consent from EagerWords, except as permitted by open source licensing,
        if any, of the source code for eagerwords.com.
      </p>

      <h4>Data Collection and Use</h4>

      <p>
        Acknowledgement of Our Privacy Policy. You expressly consent to the use of
        personally identifiable information and other data and information
        as described in the Privacy Policy. Notwithstanding anything in the Privacy
        Policy, EagerWords shall have the right to collect, extract, compile,
        synthesize, and analyze non-personally identifiable data or information (data or
        information that does not identify an entity or natural person as the source)
        resulting from your access to and use of the Services. To the extent any such
        data or information is collected or generated by EagerWords, the data and
        information will be solely owned by EagerWords and may be used by EagerWords for
        any lawful business purpose without a duty of accounting to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personal Data. If you are providing data to us that is not personal to you, you
        agree that you have either provided the owner of such personal data notice or
        received permission from the owner of such personal data, as required by
        applicable law, for us to: (a) use or disclose the data in accordance with our
        Privacy Policy, (b) move the data outside of the country of residence of such
        owner of the personal data, if applicable, (c) provide the data to third
        parties, and (d) otherwise use and disclose the data in accordance with this
        Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data Compilations and Aggregation. You give EagerWords permission to combine
        identifiable and non-identifiable information you enter or upload to the
        Services with that of other users of the Services and/or other EagerWords
        services. For example, this means that EagerWords may use your and other users'
        non-identifiable, aggregated data to improve the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        International Storage. EagerWords may access or store personal information in
        multiple countries and states, including countries and states outside of your
        own country or state to the extent permitted by applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Communications Required by Law. EagerWords may be required by law to send you
        communications about the Services or third-party products. You agree that
        EagerWords may send these communications to you via email or by posting them on
        our Services or by messaging you directly via the Platform.
      </p>

      <h4>Termination</h4>

      <p>
        EagerWords reserves the right to investigate, terminate, change, suspend, or
        discontinue the Services at its sole discretion, including without limitation,
        the availability of any feature, database, or Content as described in this
        Agreement, or your access to all or any part of the Services at any time, with
        or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately, which may
        result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your
        use of the Service and related content. You may terminate your account (and by
        implication, this Agreement) by unregistering from EagerWords.  However, any
        obligations and liabilities made by a User prior to termination of this
        Agreement shall be strictly enforced.
      </p>

      <h4>Limitation on Liability</h4>

      <p>
        Limit of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EXCEPT
        FOR LIABILITY FOR ANY AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES UNDER
        INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS, EAGERWORDS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED, UNDER
        ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR TORT
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE), ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH OR OUT OF THE
        USE OF THE PLATFORM, CONTENT, OR SERVICES, EVEN IF EAGERWORDS HAS BEEN ADVISED
        OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF
        SUBMISSIONS, OPPORTUNITY, REVENUES OR PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR
        PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES.
      </p>

      <h4>Indemnification</h4>

      <p>
        You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless EagerWords, their respective
        officers, directors, agents, and employees from and against any actions, claims,
        lawsuits, and causes of action, whether or not involving a third party,
        collectively defined as “Claims”, and all damages, awards, penalties,
        liabilities, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees arising
        out of this Agreement or your use of the services. These Claims may related to,
        but are not limited to: (a) any Content submitted or posted by you, in
        connection with the Services, or any use of the Services in violation of this
        Agreement; (b) fraud you commit or your intentional misconduct or gross
        negligence; or (c) your violation of any applicable law or rights of a
        third-party. EagerWords may select and retain counsel to represent it at your
        own expense. Without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and costs shall
        include attorney’s fees and costs required to enforce this indemnification
        provision. You shall promptly notify EagerWords of any claim or intended suit
        against EagerWords.
      </p>

      <h4>Dispute Resolution</h4>

      <p>
        For any and all disputes you may have with EagerWords, you agree to first
        contact EagerWords and attempt to resolve the dispute informally. In the
        unlikely event that EagerWords has not been able to resolve a dispute within 30
        days, you and EagerWords each agree to resolve any Claim (excluding claims for
        injunctive or other equitable relief) in connection with the Services, including
        breach or alleged breach of this Agreement by binding arbitration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless you and EagerWords mutually decide otherwise, arbitration will be
        conducted in Oakland, CA. Each party will be responsible for paying its own
        equally proportionate share of any filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees.
        The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration,
        reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for experts and other
        witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
        entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall
        prevent either party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief from the courts
        for matters related to intellectual property rights or unauthorized access to
        the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’
        INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
        CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS THE PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
        ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY
        ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND EagerWords ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A
        TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
      </p>

      <h4>Severability</h4>

      <p>
        If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so
        held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms will remain
        valid and enforceable.  Upon such determination that any term is invalid,
        illegal, or incapable of being enforced, you shall negotiate in good faith with
        EagerWords to modify this Agreement to affect the original intent of the
        drafters as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
        law.
      </p>

      <h4>No Guarantee</h4>

      <p>
        User acknowledges, understands, and agrees that EagerWords does not guarantee or
        warrant that it will find, locate, or discover all of user’s threats,
        vulnerabilities, malware, and malicious software, and users and their affiliates
        shall not hold EagerWords responsible for such failures.
      </p>

      <h4>Intellectual Property</h4>

      <p>
        All trademarks, service marks, logos, and copyrights included on the Website are
        the property of EagerWords or third parties. You may not use such Intellectual
        Property without the express, prior written consent of EagerWords or the
        applicable third party.
      </p>

      <h4>Governing Law</h4>

      <p>
        This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, without
        regard to any conflict of laws rules or principles. EagerWords’ failure to
        enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not be considered a
        waiver of those rights.
      </p>

      <h4>Entire Agreement</h4>

      <p>
        This Agreement is the complete and exclusive agreement between you and
        EagerWords regarding your access to and use of the Services. This Agreement
        supersedes any prior agreement or proposal, oral or written, and any other
        communications between you and EagerWords relating to your use of the Services.
        In the event of any conflict between the terms of any such agreement and this
        Agreement, then the terms of this Agreement shall control.
