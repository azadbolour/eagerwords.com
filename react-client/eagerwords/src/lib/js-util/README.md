## Minimal Depenedencies

The code here constitutes a pseudo-package: a wannabe npm package.

It is not yet made into a library because we ran out of time fixing technical
issues with creating a library for it and being able to run tests within the
library project. 

It is intended that this pseudo-package have minimal [transitive] dependencies.

Its initial direct dependencies were just {'detect-it'}. 

TODO. Create a dependencu checker script for this pseudo-package, based 
on an explicit dependency list.
