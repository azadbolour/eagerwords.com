Authentication Test Cases

In all cases end with a happy login and go to the games page.

Test Case 1 - Happy signup and login
OK

Test Case 2 - Wrong token for signup
OK

Test Case 3 - Wrong token for login
OK

Test case 4 - Timeout on signup init - happy repeat
              Unrecoverable error - ditto

Test case 5 - Timeout of signup confirm simulated - happy repeat
              Signup confirm took too long - happy repeat
              Same for unrecoverable err - simulated

Test case 6 - similar to 4-5 but for login

Test case 7 - Login expires by the time we get to games.

Test case 8 - Repeated login should be harmless.

Test case 9 - Repeated sign-up should be an error.

Test case 10 - Try to login without having signed up.
OK

Test case 11 - Sign up and go immediately to the game2 page.
               Then refresh. 

We get not logged in.
The problem is that refresh takes us back to index, and we lose our redux store.
Maybe leave this for later. You need to persist the store.

They have some sample code there.

The authState was not updated after signUp - both client and token are null.

It says not logged in. isLoggedIn from the server was successful - 
so the server does not know logged in after going to home page from 
signing up

The login record is there and looks good in the database, expiration 
is later than now.

Server recieved:

AuthEvidence(782d6a1e-49ff-4bd0-9c0d-990a500c0d3d,3715b325-a608-41f7-9d9b-9bcada0ebf6d)

The login record in the database is

f95401c0-fdf7-41bb-a22e-f08d887ac113|
azadbolour@bolour.com|
782d6a1e-49ff-4bd0-9c0d-990a500c0d3d|
3715b325-a608-41f7-9d9b-9bcada0ebf6d|
1|
1591327131|
1591319930

So the client id and token are good.

apiResult - log the actual return response

scala server - isLoggedIn log every step of islogged in - including times
