<p>
To play, drag and drop letters to form a word using an existing board letter
(if any) and click <em>Commit Word</em> to play that word. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Points are associated with board locations - not with letters. 
</li>
<li>
The assignment of points to board locations varies from game to game.
</li>
<li>
The score of a play is the sum of points associated with the locations
it captures. Pre-existing letters used in word formation do not contribute
to the score.
</li>
<li>
A word play on a non-empty board must <em>contain</em> at least one existing letter.
</li>
<li>
A word play on an empty board is unrestricted.
</li>
<li>
The played word and any crosswords formed by the play must exist in the
game's dictionary. 
</li>
<li>
Letters for play are generated randomly based on the frequency of 
letters in the English lexicon as per:
<a href="http://www.oxfordmathcenter.com/drupal7/node/353">Oxford Math Center</a>. 
Successive letters are generated independently of each other.
There is no notion of a container of letters getting depleted or letters being
'used up'.
</li>
<li>
When no board play is possible, a single letter is swapped for another (by dropping it onto the
<em>Swap Drop</em>). 
</li>
<li>
A game ends upon 10 consecutive swaps or when the board is full. 
</li>
<li>
If there is no activity on a game for N minutes, the game becomes 
inactive (suspended). A suspended game may be resumed from the <em>Games</em>
page, which lists the user's games.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note. This game and its rules may evolve over time based on user experience.
</p>
<h4>Noteworthy</h4>

<p>
You may wish to install a dictionary plugin in your browser to 
easily search for the meanings of words played by the machine.
</p>
<p>
Make sure the status field below the board is visible.
</p>
<h4>Configuration</h4>

There are a number of configuration parameters that you may customize as 
as registered user in the <em>Settings</em> page.

<ul>
<li>
<em>starting player</em> Random (user or machine) by default.
</li>
<li>
<em>board dimension</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>letter tray capacity</em> The number of available letters to each player
for play at any given time.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Issues</h4>

The game's dictionary is based on:

<p>
http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3201/files/CROSSWD.TXT -
</p>
<p>
a comprehensive list of common English words.
</p>
<p>
But from time to time, you'll run into a common word that is 
not in the dictionary. 
</p>
<p>
Please add issues and ideas for improvment (including any missing common words
in the dictionary) to the 
<a href="https://github.com/azadbolour/eagerwords/issues">issues list.</a>
