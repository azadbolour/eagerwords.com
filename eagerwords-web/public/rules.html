<div style="font-size: 25px; color: #009FFF; text-align: center">EagerWords Rules</div>

<p>
    To play, drag and drop letters to form a word using an existing board letter
    (if any) and click <em>Commit Word</em> to play that word. Word play is
    left-to-right/top-down.
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">
        Points are associated with board locations - not with letters.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">
        The assignment of points to board locations varies from game to game.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">
        The score of a play is the sum of the points associated with the locations
        it captures. Pre-existing letters used in word formation do not contribute
        to the score.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">
        A word play on a non-empty board must <em>contain</em> at least one existing letter.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">
        A word play on an empty board is unrestricted.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">
        The played word and any crosswords formed by the play must exist in the
        game's dictionary.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">
        Letters for play are generated randomly based on the frequency of
        letters in the English lexicon as per:
        <a href="http://www.oxfordmathcenter.com/drupal7/node/383">Oxford Math Center</a>.
        Successive letters are generated independently of each other.
        There is no notion of a container of letters getting depleted or letters being
        'used up'.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">
        A <em>play</em> is either a word play, or a letter swap.
        To swap, drag and drop a tray letter onto the <em>Swap Drop</em>.
        The system will replace it with another.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">
        A game ends when the board is full, or upon 10 consecutive swaps.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">
        A <em>dead point</em> is a square that cannot possibly be filled
        by a legal word play. The system detects some dead points, and
        grays them out.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">
        If there is no activity on a game for N minutes, the game becomes
        inactive (suspended). A suspended game may be resumed from
        the <em>Games</em> page, which lists the user's games.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Note. This game and its rules may evolve over time based on user experience.

<div style="font-size: 22px; color: #009FFF; text-align: left">Issues</div>

<p>
The game's dictionary is based on:
</p>

<p>
    http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3201/files/CROSSWD.TXT -
    a comprehensive list of common English words.
</p>
<p>
    But from time to time, you'll run into a common word that is
    not in the dictionary.
</p>
<p>
    Please add issues and ideas for improvement (including any missing common words
    in the dictionary)
    to the <a href="https://github.com/azadbolour/eagerwords.com/issues" target="_blank">issues list.</a>
