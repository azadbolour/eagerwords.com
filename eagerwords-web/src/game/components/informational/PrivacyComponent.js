        <b>Effective date: October 1, 2020</b>
      </p>

      <h4>The Basics</h4>

      <p>
        When you register with EagerWords, you provide us with your email address and your
        nickname ("Personally Identifying Information", PII). Your email address is used to
        uniquely identify you to the site. EagerWords uses passwordless authentication.
        To login to EagerWords, you supply your email address, EagerWords sends a login
        token to your email address, and you use that token to login to EagerWords. Your
        nickname is used to personalize some of the data presented to you on the site.
        Your email address and [possibly] your nickname are the only PII we collect
        about you.
      </p>
      <p>
        EagerWords does not collect any information from guest users.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a registered users, EagerWords keeps track of your game and other
        preferences, and the games you have played ("User-Specific Information", USI).
      </p>
      <p>
        The PII and USI as described above constitute the only information we collect
        that is associated with specific users. Your PII and USI are available to you
        only (by logging in), and not to any other user or entity.
      </p>
      <p>
        EagerWords does not share your PII or USI with any third party. Nor does it
        obtain information about you from third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that anyone having access to your email account can use
        EagerWords as yourself to access and modify your information. Such
        modification includes unregistering from the site,
        thereby causing all your PII and USI to be permanently deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        For internal use, EagerWords may collect other information not related to
        specific users that will help it improve its services ("Non-Specific
        Information", NSI).
      </p>
      <p>
        EagerWords may use cookies to monitor, manage, enhance and improve its Services.
        You may choose to block cookies in your browser. Blocking cookies may prevent
        you from using the full range of our services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that we may be obliged to communicate with you by your email when required by
        law, or if there is important information you need to know about EagerWords
        that cannot otherwise be provided to you in a timely fashion. EagerWords does
        not use your email for marketing purposes.
      </p>

      <h4>Removing Your Information</h4>

      <p>
        You may unregister from EagerWords at any time. Unregistering will remove all of
        your information from the active EagerWords site.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, internally data may still remain in backups, and/or be retained
        for legal reasons and to satisfy any of the authorized uses under
        our Terms of Use. For example, EagerWords may use retained data to
        prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoings in connection with the
        Services or to comply with legal obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In rare circumstances, EagerWords may be forced to recover its database from
        backups. Such recovery can, in principle, also restore your registration and
        user information. Please make sure you have remained unregistered 30 days after
        unregistration. In the rare event that EagerWords was forced to do a backup
        restoration that also restored your registration, please unregister again.
      </p>

      <h4>Updates</h4>

      <p>
        An update to the EagerWords site may include an update to this Privacy Policy.

        A change in that date is an indication for you to review this Privacy
        Policy again. You may unregister from EagerWords should an update to the Privacy
        Policy no longer meet your privacy needs.
      </p>
