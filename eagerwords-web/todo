[UX]

- For dimension of 17, machine play is slow and leads to flashing. May want
  increase delay before spinner to 1/2 second.

[Bugs]

- Signing up with an already-signed-up email - you get both the error decorator
  but within it you get the Eula. Should not present Eula in case of an error.
  Use decorator and test again.

[Simple Cleanup]

- Turn off clientId and token when an unrecoverable error occurs.

- Timeouts are unrecoverable - they should be long: 1 minute.

[Cleanup]

- Make sure we fail fast in case of exceptions in server side Module
  initialization.

- Use best practices for styling components - define classes in a companion 
  module to each component.

- What environment file is used for integration tests??
  For now they are all the same. TODO. Should distinguish and document.

- GameController needs all the exception processing of the kernel controller.
  So unprocessable of Kernel controller needs to be public and used by other 
  controllers. Add that to GameController.

- Add LoggedOutException. And use in KernelServiceImpl checkLogin.
  Include on client side.

  loginExpired should be renamed to loggedOut everywhere callbacks etc.

[Nice to Have]

- Unrecoverable errors need to be more user-friendly and specialized.
  No need for we are sorry if it is a user error bt still needs to be reset.

- The entire error text should be provided in the modal.
  No generic text - no "we are sorry" - only do it for system errors.

- Use bootstrap components for inputs, e.g., dropdowns in the settings
  component.
