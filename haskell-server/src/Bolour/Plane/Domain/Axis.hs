-- | One of the axes of the board.
--   X designates a horizontal line of the board.

--   An index value associated with Y is a row number. A size the height.

--   Note however that the first coordinate of a Point is a row, and its second
--   coordinate is a column. That is probably a mistake since it is inconsistent
--   with the use of axes. But for historical reasons still remains in the code base.
