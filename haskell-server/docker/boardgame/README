TODO. UPGRADE DOCKER FOR HASKELL.

The Process

- git pull origin master

- rm -rf /opt/data/boardgame/haskell/package/ 

  Clean up earlier build output.

- cd haskell-server; package.sh

  Build and put the executable and needed files in /opt/data/boardgame/haskell/package/

- At this point, if needed, the distribution may be tested by:

  cd /opt/data/boardgame/haskell/package/
  boardgame-server

- build-boardgame-haskell-server.sh azadbolour 0.9.5 /opt/data/boardgame/haskell/package/

  Build the server docker image.

- docker ps -a | grep boardgame-haskell-server:0.9.5 | awk '{print $1}'

- docker stop ...

- docker rm ...

- rm nohup.out

  Clear out the output file.

- run-docker-server.sh 0.9.5

- tail -f nohup.out

- docker push azadbolour/boardgame-scala-server:0.9.5

- docker pull azadbolour/boardgame-scala-server:0.9.5


Notes

We do not currently use a docker container for building the server, because
downloading the required libraries and compiling them is time-consuming.

The following files are not tested and may need some tweaking when needed
to do builds in docker. See the corresponding README for scala-server for
details about using these.

Dockerfile.boardgame-haskell-packager
build-boardgame-haskell-packager.sh
run-docker-packager.sh

Circa 3/2020. On the MAC doing a docker login as one commend, and following by docker push
as another command leads to "requested access to the resource is denied". The authentication
does not persist for some reason. So on the MAC I had to do:

docker login --username=azadbolour docker.io && docker push azadbolour/eagerwords-server:0.5.1

all as one command. And that worked.
