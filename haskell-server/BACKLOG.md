# Haskell Server Backlog

Under construction.

## API Support

Several functions of the API are currently stubbed out. Implement those function
with Haskell-level tests. Test the functions by using eagerwords-web integration
tests. And by hooking up with the UI.

## Testing

- Test with Sqlite. Development uses Postgres.
